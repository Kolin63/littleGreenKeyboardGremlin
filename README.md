# Little Green Keyboard Gremlin
Little Green Keyboard Gremlin is a Roguelike-Wordle mashup. 

Your goal is to smash the little Gremlin that is hiding beneath your keys, but you need to spell real words when pressing the keys. 

This game has a twist of strategy to it, where you have to determine if you want to type a letter or try to skip it. 

At the end of each word that you spell out, you get to spend your earnings at a shop where you can get health, items, and upgrades. Dying will cause you to lose all upgrades you earned and restart at square one. 

I've been playing my game for a while, and the initial learning curve is really fun. I've play tested as well, and the participants agree. So I know and understand that nobody likes having to download game jam games and just want to play them in the web, but it would mean a lot to me if you tried it out. 

Made for GMTK 2024 Game Jam. Theme "Built to Scale." I only had a bit more than 48 hours to work on this because of scheduling conflicts. So I am going to sleep for about three and a half hours now and go do stuff.
