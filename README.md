# Little Green Keyboard Gremlin
Little Green Keyboard Gremlin is a Roguelike-Wordle mashup. 

Your goal is to smash the little Gremlin that is hiding beneath your keys, but you need to spell real words when pressing the keys. 

This game has a twist of strategy to it, where you have to determine if you want to type a letter or try to skip it. 

At the end of each word that you spell out, you get to spend your earnings at a shop where you can get health, items, and upgrades. Dying will cause you to lose all upgrades you earned and restart at square one. 

Made for the GMTK 2024 Game Jam. Theme "Built to Scale." I only had a bit more than 48 hours to work on this because of scheduling conflicts.

# Install Instructions
Only works on Windows. 
To run, unzip the folder and run the .exe
Don't modify the .txt file please! 

Upon opening the game, press Space. If you see a jumble of hashtags, make your window bigger in both directions or zoom out (Ctrl and -) until the hashtags make a rectangle. All graphics will fit within that rectangle, so feel free to scale the window down so that it fits perfectly.
